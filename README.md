# AtomicNet
**Net built with logic Units of AND, NOT**
*************
To-do list:
1. replace multi-adds ops in convolution and test its performance;
2. replace weights and bias system with permutation of logic units;
3. checkout Assembly coding for speed-up;


For matrix multiplication,

$$
f_{NOT}(x) = 1 - x
$$

$$
f_{AND}(x,y) = x \times y
$$
